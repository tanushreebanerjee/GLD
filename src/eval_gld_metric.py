    # GeoFix: the SAME TWO CONDITIONING SLOTS, at LEVEL 0.
    #
    # Everything below defaults to OFF, and OFF is byte-identical to the code
    # that shipped before this block existed. `geofix_mask=None` skips
    # `grade_camera_mask` entirely; `geofix_artifact_images=None` skips both the
    # extra encode and `fill_cond_artifact`; `geofix_gamma == 1.0` is an
    # explicit no-op BRANCH rather than a `pow(1.0)`, because `x ** 1.0` is not
    # guaranteed bit-identical to `x` for every float and this function feeds
    # numbers that are compared bit-exactly. So every existing caller, and every
    # RESULTS.md number that came through this function, is unaffected.
    #
    # ## Why level 0 at all, given it buys no resolution
    #
    # GLD's "levels" are DA3 BLOCK DEPTHS, not resolutions: level 0 is block 5,
    # level 1 is block 7, and BOTH are (B*V, 1536, 36, 36). Moving the mask here
    # buys no spatial resolution whatsoever -- only semantic depth. (The header
    # comment of DA3_level1.yaml claiming 518 / 37x37 is stale; its own params
    # say 504.)
    #
    # ## This is NOT the "do not blend at both levels" rule
    #
    # CLAUDE.md's rule -- +0.100 dB for `oracle_bin` and -0.268 dB for
    # `oracle_abs` when compositing at level 0 on top of level 1 -- is about
    # BLENDING: mixing latents into x_t during sampling. It is a rule against
    # applying the SAME composite twice, when the cascade already propagates the
    # first one. CONDITIONING is a different operation: the network READS the
    # slot instead of being averaged with it, nothing is applied twice, and
    # docs/ARCH_NOTES.md records the opposite prediction as an intended
    # contribution. **No level-0 CONDITIONING result exists in RESULTS.md, for
    # either sign.** Do not cite the blending numbers as a forecast for these.
    #
    # ## >>> LOAD-BEARING CAVEAT -- READ BEFORE SCORING ANYTHING WITH THESE <<<
    #
    # `third_party/gld/checkpoints/da3_cascade.pt` HAS NEVER SEEN EITHER INPUT.
    # It was trained with `cond_channel[:, cond_num:]` all zeros and with camera
    # channel 0 a strict {0, 1} that was also spatially CONSTANT WITHIN EACH
    # VIEW. Switching these arguments on against that checkpoint does not add a
    # conditioning signal; it hands a converged model an off-distribution input
    # at inference, where nothing can adapt.
    #
    # How far off-distribution: the level-1 route through the identical two
    # slots produced gradient norms of 269.5 (mean over steps 0-9, 10/10 above
    # the clip threshold) and took ~70 steps of LR warmup to fall below 10 --
    # the full table is in src/utils/geofix_slots.py. That is the cost measured
    # on a network that WAS allowed to adapt.
    #
    # So: **these arguments are for AFTER a cascade finetune**, using
    # gld-session7/configs/training/DA3_geofix_cascade.yaml. Scoring the
    # released cascade with them on and reporting the null would not be a
    # negative result about level-0 conditioning; it would be a measurement of
    # the distribution shift wearing a conditioning result's name.

            would put the conditioning in a different space from the reference
            features sitting beside it in the same tensor. That failure does not
            raise; it decodes to something plausible, which is the class of bug
